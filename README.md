### Abstract
Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable accuracy for most image classification machine learning tasks.  However, these networks remain susceptible to adversarial attacks, where slight perturbations in input data produces a misclassification.  Without effective defense, this vulnerability  creates  a  significant  obstacle  to  the  practical  applications  of neural networks.  Therefore, in this paper we propose four unique interpretations of adversarial attacks designed to test the limits of adversarial defenses.  To conclude the paper we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the four defenses we designed and recommend an approach to ensure the safety and security of neural networks in the public domain.

We will cover highlights from the research project in this README document, hower, for a full and complete understanding of our work we encourage you to read the full paper.

To achieve the purpose of this research there are three main sections:
* [The Neural Network Architecture](#Neural-Networks)
* [The Adverserial Attack Methods](#Adverserial-Attacks)
* [The Network Defense Methods](#Defense)

## Neural Networks

The NeuralNetworks folder contains the neural network architecture for 3 main datasets: 
* [MNIST](#MNIST-Dataset)
* [GTSRB](#GTSRB-Dataset)
* [CIFAR10](#CIFAR10-Dataset)

Our neural network consists of 2 convolutional layers each containing a convolution and pooling layer, followed by 3 dense layers used to constrain outputs to the desired number of classes. Pictured below is an example of the implemented CNN structure for the MNIST Dataset.

## Adverserial Attacks
The finalized adverserial attack methods generated by the team are:
* [FGSM and IFGSM](#Fast-Gradient-Sign-Method-(FGSM)-and-Iterative-Fast-Gradient-Sign-Method-(IFGSM))
* [DeepFool](#DeepFool)
* [Carolini and Wagner](#Carolini-and-Wagner-(CW))
* [Iterative Pixel Swap](#Iterative-Pixel-Swap)

We additionally designed a JSMA attack that ultimately we did not have time to perfect and implement for our final results, but the algorithm is included here as it is mostly complete.
* [JSMA](#Jacobian-Saliency-Map-Attack-(JSMA))
