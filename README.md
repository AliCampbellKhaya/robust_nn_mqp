# Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Neural Networks
Repository for work on Robust Neural Networks MQP \
Authors: Alasdair Campbell and Jared Lasalle

There are 3 main components of this project:
* [The Neural Network Architecture](#Neural-Networks)
* [The Adverserial Attack Methods](#Adverserial-Attacks)
* [The Network Defense Methods](#Defense)

The authors of this project also wrote a paper describing the work. \
Estimated completion time of paper: March 2024 \
Link to paper will be provided once it is completed

## Neural Networks

The NeuralNetworks folder contains the neural network architecture for 3 main datasets: 
* [MNIST](#MNIST-Dataset)
* [GTSRB](#GTSRB-Dataset)
* [CIFAR10](#CIFAR10-Dataset)
